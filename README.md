# alu-web_react

ALU web curriculum exercises for TypeScript and Webpack.

This repository contains two separate project tracks:

- `TypeScript/` for the TypeScript exercises
- `Webpack/` for the Webpack exercises

## TypeScript

The TypeScript exercises live under `TypeScript/`:

- `task_0` - basic types, interfaces, and DOM rendering
- `task_1` - teachers, directors, classes, and function typing
- `task_2` - advanced types and type predicates
- `task_3` - ambient declarations and external module typing
- `task_4` - namespaces and declaration merging
- `task_5` - branded nominal typing

## Webpack

The Webpack exercises live under `Webpack/`:

- `task_0` - basic webpack setup with jQuery
- `task_1` - webpack config, lodash debounce, and public output
- `task_2` - CSS, images, and asset optimization
- `task_3` - development server, modules, and code splitting

## Usage

Each task folder contains its own configuration files and entry points.

Install the dependencies inside the task you want to run, then use the build or dev script defined in that task's `package.json`.

For example:

- `TypeScript/task_0` through `TypeScript/task_5` for the TypeScript project
- `Webpack/task_0` through `Webpack/task_3` for the Webpack project

## Build And Run

TypeScript tasks:

- Run `npm run build` inside the task folder to type-check and bundle the exercise.
- Some tasks also include `npm run start-dev` for local development.

Webpack tasks:

- Run `npm run build` inside the task folder to generate the production bundle.
- Run `npm run start-dev` in `Webpack/task_3` to launch the development server on port `8564`.

## Notes

- All task code lives in source files where possible.
- The repository includes the files required by the manual checks for each exercise.
